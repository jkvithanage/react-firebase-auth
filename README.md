# React-Firebase Authentication

- This [tutorial](https://youtu.be/PKwu15ldZ7k?si=3qzIotFh0Rmtns8m) by Web Dev Simplified was the inspiration, but it is kind of outdated, as Firebase and React Router have changed over the past couple of years.
- Firebase can be replaced with your own server, and all you need to do is modify the AuthProvider function to set the signUp, signIn and signOut logic.
